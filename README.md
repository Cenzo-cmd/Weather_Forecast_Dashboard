"Sunshine is delicious, rain is refreshing, wind braces us up, snow is exhilarating; there is really no such thing as bad weather, only different kinds of good weather." 
~ John Ruskin

This dashboard was created to easily browse different cities and get the current day and 5 day weather forecast.  Upon opening the dashboard, there is a search bar on the left to enter a city.  When the city is entered, it will automatically pull information from [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) and gives you a simplistic user interface with lots of content.

Every time a city is searched, the cities will be generated into a list which is stored into local storage so if the page is refreshed, your recent searched cities will still be there.  The UV index displays 3 colors based on the severity of the index, Green - low, Yellow - mild, Red - high.<br>

Another featured that was added was the remove buttons on each city item.  When <img src="assets/images/removeButton.png"> is clicked, the city will automatically be removed from the list and local storage will be updated. <br> Local storage is saved as a stringified array with the cities as the value.
